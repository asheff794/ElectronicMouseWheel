# ElectronicMouseWheel
An electronic mouse wheel for tracking activity of mice over time. A small neodymium magnet is attached to a mouse wheel, and a hall effect sensor logs the time during each pass of the magnet. This cannot differentiate the direction the mouse is running, but works for purposes of general activity tracking. I performed this work as a technician in Gloria Choi's lab at MIT.


#### Necessary Components
* Raspberry Pi
* Mouse Wheel (I used the Kaytee Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel - Mini) 
* US5881 Hall Effect Sensor
* Neodymium magnet (D7H2, K&J Magnetics)
